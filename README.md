Hello!
---
My name is Spencer Dent. I am currently a master's student enrolled at the University of West Georgia.

In my current classes, we are working in Java and PHP, but in my free time I prefer to work in JavaScript and PureScript.

For this school account, I'm not really looking to collab unless it is for a school project.
I would like to keep this account specifically for my class projects and have my other account for personal projects.

If you need to reach out to me, I think the best route would be to send me an email.
My school address is: sd00070@my.westga.edu
